    <p>My favorite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot. But I have never travel by the ship yet.
        I love to travel without a group and without a guide, despite the fact that I often find ourselves in a difficult situation in unfamiliar places. Usually, I travel with my husband or with my friends. Most of all I like to travel by car and spend a little time at different places. Although long journeys are tiring me sometimes, but that doesn't stop me. </p>
